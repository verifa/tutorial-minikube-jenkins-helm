Steps:
1. Setup Jenkins

2. Create Jenkins pipeline:
    a. Can we do this through the UI? i.e. generate the Jenkinsfile?
    b. Jenkinsfile would check-out code and run build... mention that best practice is to store Jenkinsfile in source code
    c. (optional) some tests... put results in Jenkins...
    d. (optional) archive build outputs

3. After thing summary... how this looks in a real project
